# NYU_Clery_Investigation

Thanks for stopping by! This is Simon Tan, an aspiring journalist with a skillset encompassing writing, photography, data and visualization. My website is: https://simon7.myportfolio.com/

The R Markdown file in the repository contains the code that I used to create this story: https://simon7.myportfolio.com/on-campus-more-crimes-than-reported

Some files are too large to be saved in Github but they are obtainable via NYC Open Data and NYU Department of Campus Security. Please feel free to if you feel like reproducing my work!

A friendly heads-up: the NYPD seems to have changed its CRS system in 2020, which is the reason why I only compared stats from 2021-23 in the latter half of the document. The department didn't reply to my inquiry email.
